          What is document object model (DOM)

          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that
            represents an HTML document as a tree structure. It provides a way
            for JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the elements,
            attributes, and content of an HTML document. Â

          How do you select an element from the DOM?
        </div>

          <p>
            To select elements in the DOM using JavaScript, you can use the
            following methods: getElementById: Finds an element based on its
            unique ID. getElementsByClassName: Searches for elements by class
            name. getElementsByTagName: Searches for elements by tag name.
            querySelector: Uses CSS selectors to find an element.
            querySelectorAll: Returns a list of all elements that match a given
            selector

          What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it
          useful?

          <p>
            Event Delegation is a pattern based upon the concept of Event
            Bubbling. It is an event-handling pattern that allows you to handle
            events at a higher level in the DOM tree other than the level where
            the event was first received.
